      {
        "question": "How do \"competencies\" differ from tags/topics?",
        "answer": "Competencies describe professionally important skills that content develops. Unlike tags (keywords) or topics (knowledge areas), competencies focus on what a person will be able to do after studying the content. For example, instead of the tag \"Python\", a competency might be \"Python Programming\" or \"Web Application Development\"."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can different types of content be labeled (videos/articles/events)?",
        "answer": "Yes, our classifier works with various types of educational content: video courses, articles, webinars, offline events, podcasts, and other formats. The main thing is the presence of descriptive information about the content (title, description, program)."
      },
      {
        "question": "How often can labeling be updated and new items added?",
        "answer": "You can send updates at any convenient time. We support both full catalog reload and incremental updates (adding new items or changing existing ones). Frequency depends on the selected plan and data volume."
      },
      {
        "question": "What transfer formats are supported besides API?",
        "answer": "In addition to REST API, we support file uploads in CSV and JSON formats, integration with cloud storage (S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob), as well as secure file transfer by individual agreement. The choice depends on your security requirements and data volumes."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I get a sample labeling before the pilot?",
        "answer": "Yes, we provide labeling samples for quality assessment. You can send a small sample of your content (5-10 items), and we will perform a trial labeling free of charge. This will allow you to evaluate the result before starting the pilot project."
      },
      {
        "question": "How is privacy/security handled?",
        "answer": "All data is transmitted over secure channels (TLS/SSL), access is via API keys with permission restrictions. Your data is used exclusively for labeling and is not shared with third parties. We are ready to sign NDA and data processing agreements. Upon request, we provide detailed security documentation."
